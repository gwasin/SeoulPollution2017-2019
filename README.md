This project analyzes air pollution in Seoul using EDA, heatmaps, and machine learning (TSLM, LSTM/GRU) with Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul

Highlights

📊 PM2.5 trends: 24.1 → 21.2 → 28.3 µg/m³ (2017–2019)

❄️ Seasonality: Highest in Winter & Spring

🌙 Patterns: Night > Day; Sunday most polluted

📍 Hotspots: Central & traffic-heavy districts

🤖 ML models: LSTM/GRU forecast seasonal spikes (loss ~0.083)

🧪 Scenario: -10% NO₂ → -9.62% PM2.5

Implication

Data science can not only describe problems but also simulate solutions for evidence-based urban policy.
